toc::[]

This guide covers the documentation around the Javascript client used for connecting to the websocket server.

== Installation
You can install the package from npm and then bundle it using Webpack or rollup.

[source, bash]
----
npm i @adonisjs/websocket-client
----

and then import it as follows

[source, js]
----
import Ws from '@adonisjs/websocket-client'
const ws = Ws('ws://localhost:3333')
----

Also you can grab the UMD bundle from unpkg.
[source, html]
----
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@adonisjs/websocket-client"></script>
<scrip>
  const ws = adonis.Ws('ws://localhost:3333')
</script>
----

== Polyfill
The module build requires link:https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-regenerator[regenerator-runtime] polyfill, so make sure to add it via babel.

== Production builds
The development build contains a bunch of log statements, so it is recommended to use link:https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/[Webpack DefinePlugin] or link:https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-replace[rollup-plugin-replace] in order to define `NODE_ENV`.

== Getting started
Let's get started by connecting to the Websocket server and make some subscriptions.

[source, js]
----
const ws = Ws(url, options)
----

If `url` is not defined, it will fallback to the current hostname.
