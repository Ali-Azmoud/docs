= Error & Exceptions Handling

toc::[]

AdonisJs takes an additional step towards handling and throwing exceptions by making sure exceptions throwing by the core of the framework are more descriptive and helpful for debugging. Also it offers additional tools & practices to strcuture well designed exception messages.

== Why Are Exceptions Important?
Exceptions do not get the care they deserve. Majority of programmers thinks of exceptions a way of terminating the process as something bad happened. Even worse exception messages do not share much context on how to fix the problem and leaves it to the end-user to figure out the root cause.

With AdonisJs we tag all exceptions with a unique *Error code* and you can refer the documentation of the given error code to understand the root cause of the exception.

Not only that, we also offer you a nice npm package called link:https://npmjs.org/package/node-exceptions[node-exceptions, window="_blank"] to setup application specific exception classes to throw personal and meaningful exceptions.

== Error Codes
Below is the list of error codes thrown by the core of AdonisJs. You can reference them to understand the context of the exception.

All exceptions are divided into multiple categories like *General*, *Database*, *Redis*, etc.

=== General
