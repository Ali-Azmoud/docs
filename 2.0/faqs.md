## What is the goal of Adonis ?
We are not on a mission of 100%. Which means Adonis cannot be everything to everyone. NodeJs has a huge ecosystem and generally all modules tries to be minimal and configurable, which is a nice thing but it comes with a cost. First you have to dig into making the choice on which package is the best fit your project. Where to put the startup code, how to organize files and folders and many more like this.

Adonis itself is quite modular, we have ton of service providers which  glues up together to make your project, but we do not leave hard decisions on you and pre-configure everything you need to setup a web server and it is following benefits.

1. You do not have to get into the cycle of setting up the project from scratch every time.
