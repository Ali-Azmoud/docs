= Routing

HTTP routes open the gateway for outside world to interact with your application using URL's. AdonisJs router maps URL's to actions and will invoke them once a certain URL is called by the end-user.

All routes are defined inside `app/Http/routes.js` file which is autoloaded at the time of starting the HTTP Server. Let's start with a basic example

== Basic Example
.app/Http/routes.js
[source, javascript]
----
const Route = use('Route')

Route.get('/', function * (request, response) {
  response.send('This is the home page')
})
